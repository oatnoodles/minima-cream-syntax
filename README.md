# minima cream syntax
 an off-white, muted pastel syntax theme for [pulsar editor](https://pulsar-edit.dev/).

### ui themes
 works best with my ui theme _minima cream ui_, which is based off [_minima gp light_](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) by geordiep. this has not been tested with other ui themes, so use at your own risk.

### credits
 - based off [_pen paper coffee_](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) syntax by nylki.
 - and [_minima gp light_](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) by geordiep.

### issues
 if you have any troubles installing or using the theme, let me know of course, but i likely won't know how to fix it. i'll always accept help if anyone offers it, though, so if you have a solution please tell me!

 ### note
 i am a novice programmer and as such this will be messy and probably have bugs/weird stuff i don't know how to fix. install at your own risk.
 i use this theme personally so i doubt it'll be harmful â€” just spaghetti at worst.
